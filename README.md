## General Suggestions

- Include rich media as much as possible. Videos are highly encouraged and we do not have any size limitation as we will host your video on YouTube and embed it inside your blog so the higher quality the video the better.
- Be genuine and share your experiance.


## ❗ We May Edit Your Content

Edits are usually very minimal, and chiefly concerned with grammar and spelling. Rarely, we may also rephrase or alter areas that are incorrect or give a poor impression. If you have any contention with any of these edits, please let us know and we may come to a compromise.

## 🖼️ Media (images, gifs, videos)
- Give files brief, meaningful names with dashes (e.g., `Image.webp` -> `hungry-dog.webp`)
- When adding an image, the `[]` portion will become HTML alt text. This is for blind persons' screen readers and web crawlers, so describe the image here. For example: `![dog eating a carrot beside a barn](hungry-dog.jpg)`
- Reduce image/video file sizes and dimensions as much as possible, *while keeping them as large and quality as you want* them to appear on the screen. If you think an image is big enough at 300px, make it 300px. (It's unlikely we will ever need an image over 1000px.)
- Prefer `.mp4` or `.webp` to `.gif` (GIFs can be 5-10 times larger than an efficiently encoded MP4)
- Prefer `.webp` to other types for image files (you can convert free online)
- Downsize images as much as possible to the max size you might want to see it have on the website
- If you'd like to embed a Youtube video, get the embedded URL and use this structure where the alt text is "iframe": ![iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/-HVevxqqUOM?si=e5nc5AJ5xmoWx8sN)
- If you'd like to add a locally stored video, use this structure where the alt text is "video": ![video](example.jpg)

## Markdown Syntax
- Don't use HTML (e.g., `<img src="cat.jpg"/>`)
